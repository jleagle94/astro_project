# hello-world
This is my second git-hub repository. Technically, it's my first ever but my aws_projects and others have been given way more love. I will now use my hello-world repository for my Radiative Processes course (ASTR8100). I will rename this repository to reflect this. It is now called "astr_project" 

On 11/8/19 I revisited to recall how to do a pull request before submitting for Homework 30 in ASTR 8100.

On 11/11/2019 I made another small change to this file for homework 31.

Develop branch is working on a Cherenkov shower frequency spectrum for one moving charged particle emitting at the Frank-Tamm formula across 100MeV to 2TeV. The particle moves through Earth's atmosphere. We calculate nuFnu and log(nu) for plotting.
