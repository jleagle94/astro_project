# hello-world
This is my second git-hub repository. Technically, it's my first ever but my aws_projects and others have been given way more love. I will now use my hello-world repository for my Radiative Processes course (ASTR8100). I will rename this repository to reflect this. It is now called "astr_project".

My project focuses on Cherenkov light. First, I play with making a quick SED for one charged particle moving in a medium traveling faster than the speed of light and radiating Chereknov light. 
The second half is a movie of the particle radiating Cherenkov light as it moves along a straight line. The interesting thing to notice is how light is continually emitted from the electron as it moves, 
creating arrival time differences of the light as seen by an observer who thus sees pulses of radiation. 
Cherenkov light is a common way to observe high energy gamma rays that cascade into showers of charged particles in the Earth's atmosphere. See the notebook for an illustration.


------As of 12/2/2019-------
Develop branch is working on a Cherenkov shower frequency spectrum for one moving charged particle emitting at the Frank-Tamm formula across 100MeV to 2TeV. 
The particle moves through a Cherenkov water tank. We calculate nuFnu and log(nu) for plotting.
